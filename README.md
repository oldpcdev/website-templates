# Nice CSS
### Access https://oldpcdev.github.io/website-templates/index.html for better visualization.
Nice CSS is a project where I design pages for anyone who is interested in making a website. I make this project to test and share my experience. You have the freedom to use my styles however you want. But please, don't use my templates for making bad things, like a porn website. It gives people a bad impression.
Attribution is not mandatory, but it would be nice if you add a link at the bottom of the page.
